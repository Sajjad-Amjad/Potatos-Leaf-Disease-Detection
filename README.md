# Potato Leaf Disease Classification

## Setup for Python:

1. Install Python 

2. Install Python packages

```
pip3 install -r training/requirements.txt
pip3 install -r api/requirements.txt
```


## Training the Model

1. Download the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).
2. Only keep folders related to Potatoes.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook in Browser.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open `training/potato-disease-training.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
5. In cell #2, update the path to dataset.
6. Run all the Cells one by one.
7. Copy the model generated and save it with the version number in the `models` folder.

## Running the API

### Using FastAPI

1. Get inside `api` folder

```bash
cd api
```

2. Run the FastAPI Server using uvicorn

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0
```

3. Your API is now running at `0.0.0.0:8000`

## Future Roadmap
